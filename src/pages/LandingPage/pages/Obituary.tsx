                  world dimmed on Sunday, September 28, 2025, when Olaseni Babatunde Olagbaju was called home to glory at Newham University Hospital, London. He departs from us, leaving behind a profound legacy of uncommon generosity, deep care, and unique impact.

              <p className="mb-4 clear-left">
   ​Born on April 24, 1951, to Joseph Oladimeji Olagbaju and Princess Mobolaji Olagbaju (née Ademiluyi), Olaseni was the cherished second child in a dynamic family of nine. His foundational years were spent at St Stephen Academy (1957–1963) and Molusi College, Ijebu Igbo (1963–1968), where the seeds of his intellectual curiosity were first sown.
​His passion led him to Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), where he graduated in 1974 with a BSc in Microbiology. 
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                However, Olaseni’s greatest impact on campus extended beyond the classroom: when he returned to famously managed and ran Rotunda, an iconic building that served as the energetic hub of student life and the nascent tech scene at OAU. It was here that he cultivated connections and mentored others, embodying the community spirit that defined him.
He moved to the UK in 1988.
              </p>

              <p>
                Throughout his 74 years, Olaseni was a magnetic force. His unique spirit touched the lives of all who knew him; his generosity knew no bounds. He truly connected with people.
​While the loss is immeasurable for the family he leaves behind, we take comfort in the knowledge that to all who knew him, Olaseni was more than a friend or family member; he was a force of positive impact, his generosity touching and transforming countless lives. His unique spirit will be deeply missed, but the profound legacy of his kindness remains etched in the hearts of all who have crossed his path.
              </p>

								​May the blessings of a life well-lived accompany Olaseni into eternal rest.
